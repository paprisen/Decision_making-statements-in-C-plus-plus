Aim: To study and implement C++ decision making statements.

Apparatus: Online Compiler C++

Theory: 
Program-1: Even/Odd Number Checker

This program checks whether a given number is even or odd using modular arithmetic. An even number is any integer divisible by 2 (num % 2 == 0). An odd number is any integer not divisible by 2 (num % 2 != 0). The program uses a simple if-else conditional structure to determine and display the result.

Program-2: Vowel/Consonant Checker

This program identifies whether an input character is a vowel or consonant. Vowels in English are A, E, I, O, U (both uppercase and lowercase). All other alphabetic characters are consonants. The program uses a compound conditional check with logical OR (||) operators. It checks both lowercase and uppercase vowel cases.

Program-3: Largest of Three Numbers

This program finds the largest among three given numbers using nested conditional statements. It compares each number against the other two sequentially. Uses multiple if conditions with nested ifs to check all possibilities. The logic checks all possible combinations of number magnitudes.

Program-5: Calculator

This program implements a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations on two numbers. Takes two floating-point numbers as input. Provides a menu of operations (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication). Uses switch-case to execute the selected operation. Displays the result formatted with input numbers and operation. Includes a default case for invalid operation choices.

Conclusion: Thus, we have used the conditional statements for correct output and switch case for menu-driven program.
